    <h2 class="header two">Description</h2>
    <p class="text">Sourdough bread is a rustic, artisanal bread known for its tangy flavor and chewy texture. Made with a naturally fermented starter of flour and water, this bread relies on wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria for leavening, giving it a distinctive sour taste. The dough is typically slow-fermented, allowing the flavors to develop fully before being shaped and baked. The result is a loaf with a crisp, golden-brown crust and a soft, airy interior filled with irregular holes.</p>
    <p class="text">The process of making sourdough bread is both an art and a science, requiring patience and attention to detail. The crust has a satisfying crunch, while the inside remains tender with a slight chewiness, offering a complex flavor that is both tangy and slightly sweet. Sourdough is versatile, delicious on its own, or served with butter, cheese, or as a base for sandwiches. Its unique taste and texture make it a favorite among bread enthusiasts and a staple in many kitchens.</p>
    <h2 class="header two">Ingredients</h2>
     <ul class="text">
       <li>100 grams active sourdough starter</li>
       <li>394 grams bread flour</li>
       <li>250 grams water</li>
       <li>8 grams kosher salt</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
   <h2 class="header two">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="text">
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Place starter into a bowl. Add bread flour, water, and salt; mix until well blended and sticky.</li>
      <li>Cover with aluminum foil and let stand for 4 hours at 70 to 75 degrees F (21 to 24 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Uncover dough and use wet hands to fold it over onto itself three to four times. Cover again with foil and let ferment for 2 more hours.</li>
      <li>Generously dust a proofing basket (banneton) with rice flour.</li>
      <li>Scrape dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a ball with a smooth, unbroken surface, using just enough flour on the surface to keep it from sticking. Place dough into the prepared basket with the smooth side down. Pinch the rougher edges on the surface together toward the center to smooth them while maintaining a round ball shape.</li>
      <li>Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours to slow the fermentation process.</li>
      <li>Remove the banneton from the refrigerator. Let sit in a warm spot until dough springs back slowly and retains a slight indentation when poked gently with a finger, about 3 to 5 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Dust surface of dough with flour. Gently invert the banneton over the center of the baking sheet and flip dough out onto the parchment paper. Gently brush off excess rice flour. Score top of dough about 1/8-inch deep with a sharp knife to create a shallow slit running across the center. Mist the entire surface lightly with water.</li>
      <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until beautifully browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer loaf to a wire rack and let cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
