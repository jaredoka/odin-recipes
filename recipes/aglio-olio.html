    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aglio e olio is a simple yet flavorful Italian pasta dish that highlights the essence of good ingredients. The dish features spaghetti tossed in a sauce made from olive oil, thinly sliced garlic, and red pepper flakes. As the garlic gently cooks in the olive oil, it infuses the oil with a rich, aromatic flavor. The red pepper flakes add a subtle heat, giving the dish a delightful kick without overpowering the other ingredients.</p>
    <p>Once the pasta is perfectly al dente, it’s combined with the garlic-infused oil, allowing the flavors to coat each strand. A sprinkle of fresh parsley adds a touch of brightness, while grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese can be added for extra depth. Aglio e olio is a dish that celebrates simplicity, relying on the quality of its ingredients to create a satisfying, comforting meal that is both quick to prepare and deeply flavorful.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
       <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
       <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
       <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
       <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
      <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
