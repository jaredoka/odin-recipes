This project is a simple HTML website that includes a main webpage linked to three different recipes. Each of the recipes have a picture, description, ingredients, and steps on how to make the dish itself.

In this project, I learned how to:
-Clone GitHub repositories
-Create and organize directories and files
-Create HTML boilerplates from memory
-Proper usage of elements and attributes 
  -Link webpages via anchor and including security measures via the "rel" attribute (if there is a target="_blank" attribute)
  -Embed images and to always include the alt attribute for accessibility and how to resize
  -Header and paragraph elements
  -Unordered and ordered list elements
-Git basics; git add, git commit, git push origin main
